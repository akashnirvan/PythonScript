## üíª Who Is This For?

* üßí **Beginners** who want to learn real-world Python projects
* üéô Creators interested in building voice assistants
* üß† Curious minds who want to mix GUI + AI + automation
* üíº Developers who want to package apps as `.exe` files

If you‚Äôve ever wanted to **build your own Jarvis** ‚Äî this is your start.

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack Used

* **Python 3.8+**
* `tkinter` (GUI)
* `speech_recognition` (Voice commands)
* `pyttsx3` (Text-to-Speech)
* `requests` (API calling)
* `pyaudio` (Microphone input)

## üì¶ Installation Guide

> If you want to run from Python (dev mode), follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository(Make sure git is installed)

```bash
cd path/to/your/folder
```
```
git clone https://github.com/akashnirvan/Assistant.git
```
```
cd Assistant
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### If `pyaudio` gives errors (common for beginners):

```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

---
## Some Tweak
```env
WAKER=hello
API_KEY = AIzaSyAEey2pCZn7pnWMsI1lEZ0UivR39l_9dhs
MAX_MESSAGES =10
```
* <b>you can edit WAKER so that it start to respond by your prefer word</b>
* <b>add a Api keys of a gemini </b>
* <b>Max message is for how many message it shows in a chat then delete previous one<b>
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Assistant

```bash
python Assistant.py
```

You‚Äôll see a GUI window with three buttons:

* **Wake Word Mode**
* **Instant Command Mode** (includes a slider to control how long it listens)
* **Chat Mode** (input + send button)

## üîê Gemini AI Setup

This assistant uses **Google Gemini API** to answer queries smartly.

### How to Get Your API Key:

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google Account
3. Copy your API key
4. Paste it in the code like this:

```python
API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

Now Jarvis can answer any question using Gemini‚Äôs AI engine.

## üß™ Sample Commands You Can Try

| Command                    | Action                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `open youtube.com`         | Opens YouTube in your browser          |
| `search latest tech news`  | Searches Google for "latest tech news" |
| `answer me what is python` | Gemini AI gives a short answer         |
| `stop`                     | Gracefully shuts down the assistant    |

In **Chat Mode**, you can type the same commands instead of speaking.

---

## ü™Ñ Build `.exe` File (Windows Users)

If you want to make a standalone `.exe` file:

### 1. Install PyInstaller

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### 2. Create Executable

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole jarvis_gui.py
```

Your `.exe` will appear in the `/dist` folder. You can now share it without requiring Python.
